"""
This file deterministically generates strings from a JSGF Grammar, whether there are \
        weights defined in rules or not. It requires one argument: the path to the JSGF\
        Grammar file. You can run this on the included grammar IdeasNonRecursive.gram:\


        ``python DeterministicGenerator.py IdeasNonRecursive.gram``

This will generate all strings defined by the public rules of IdeasNonRecursive.gram.\
        It is important that the grammar used by the generator is not recursive (rules \
        should not directly or indirectly reference themselves), so that the generator\
        terminates. Otherwise, you may get a maximum recursion depth exceeded error or \
        a segmentation fault.
