# @summary: This file generates sentences from a PCFG in JSGF. Run it by entering 
#   in the command line: python ProbabilisticGenerator.py <grammarFile> <numStrings>
#   where <grammarFile> is the path of the JSGF file, and <numString> is the number
#   of strings you want to generate

"""
This file probabilistically generates strings from a JSGF grammar. It takes advantage \
        of weights assigned to alternatives (separated by pipes) by choosing to \
        expand higher weighted alternatives with greater probability. For sets of \
        alternatives without weights, each alternative is equally likely to be \
        expanded. For optional groups, the elements in the group have a 50% chance \
        of being expanded. 

It requires two arguments: the path to the JSGF\
        Grammar file, and the number of strings to generate. You can run this on the \
        included grammar Ideas.gram:\


        ``python ProbabilisticGenerator.py Ideas.gram 20``

This will generate 20 sentences based on the public rule(s) in Ideas.gram, using the \
weights if they are provided.
